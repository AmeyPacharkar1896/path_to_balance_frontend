Path to Balance is a cross-platform Flutter application designed to provide users with immediate, accessible mental health screening. The app uses structured questionnaires and a powerful AI backend to deliver personalized psychological evaluations, helping users understand their mental state and providing actionable suggestions for well-being.

This project was developed by a two-person team: the Flutter frontend was built by me, and the Node.js backend was built by my collaborator.
